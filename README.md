# ðŸ“± Mobile App with Firebase Realtime Database in Xamarin (C#)

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview
This application was developed as a test project for ITES. Using Xamarin (C#), I created an app with a Firebase Realtime Database to manage student information, including their ID number, password, name, and email.

### ðŸŽ® Key Features
- **User Management:** Allows recovery and changing of passwords, as well as updating user data.
- **Certificate Generation:** Supports the creation and retrieval of Analytical and Regular Student certificates based on the user's career.
- **Academic Records:** Includes a listing of grades, completed subjects, attendance, and classroom information.

**It is worth noting that this application is still in development, and my skills continue to improve, as it was my first experience with Xamarin.**
